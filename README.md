# ComputerVision_Geology
Application of Computer Vision in the field of Geology - reconstruction subsurface properties (full-waveform inversion problems).

Summary

Computer vision, powered by deep learning, has transformed numerous domains, including medical imaging, energy exploration, autonomous vehicles, and security. In the field of geology, computer vision techniques are increasingly applied to address complex geophysical challenges, such as reconstructing subsurface velocity models through full-waveform inversion (FWI). FWI is a computationally intensive method used to estimate subsurface properties (e.g., seismic velocity, density) by iteratively minimizing the difference between observed and modeled seismic waveforms. Traditional FWI approaches often struggle with non-linearities, high computational costs, and sensitivity to initial models. Deep learning-based computer vision techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), offer promising solutions by enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of subsurface imaging.

This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of recent advancements in deep learning models for FWI, covering published works up to 2025. It also includes novel models I have developed, tailored specifically for geophysical applications. These models leverage _computer vision techniques_ to process seismic data, improve velocity model reconstruction, and address challenges like noise robustness and resolution enhancement.
